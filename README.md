# Math-Problem-Implementations

WARNING: If you are a ProjectEuler user looking here for insights into problems, turn away. You'll learn nothing by looking at these solutions. Instead, read the theory behind each problem and practice some simpler versions until you can tackle the big one. 

These solutions were implemented by Yashas Lokesh.

This repo contains implementations of solutions of problems from ProjectEuler.net in Java for now, and implementations in more languages will be added in the future as I solve each problem and understand other languages.
